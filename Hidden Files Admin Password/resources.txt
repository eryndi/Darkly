Hidden Files Admin Pass:

Flag - d19b4823e0d5600ceed56d5e896ef328d7a2b9e7ac7e80f4fcdb9b10bcb3e7ff

STEPS:
Googled how to recursively search for websites files. Came across the wget command.

Websites often forget to hide their hidden files. One way to see if hidden files exist is to use wget. After I homebrew installed the command I used the resource below and placed in the websites address to the command wget --recursive --no-parent http://10.11.200.61/

It downloaded everything from the directory and showed that there were some files that were supposed to be hidden from the url. One called .hidden and another called robots.txt

Reading robots.txt showed that there existed /.hidden and /whatever in the directory

Going into route http://10.11.200.61/whatever/ shows an htpasswd file.

Clicking on this file downloads it and shows root:8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3

Decrypting the hash shows root:dragon

Trying the username root with the password dragon on the /admin page gives us the flag.

PREVENTION:

Remove useless files from the root of your website, especially ones that contain sensitive data.
Don't include files with sensitive data in the root of your website.
Do not try to hide sensitive data with a weak cypher like md5.
Use an htaccess to protect any sensitive files.
Don't trust the robots.txt file to be secure.
