Researching how to hack upload inputs had us come across the youtube video listed below

By installing an interceptor (Burp Suite Community Edition) and having it set up with
our browser we are able to pause all post requests to see what exactly it is we are
sending through the request.

We know that the site is checking to make sure that a jpg file is being uploaded
so as to prevent files of other types from going through to the backend

We can manipulate this by creating a file that we want to send through (also
in this directory) and adding .jpg to the end of it

We then select it on the upload page, and when we click send the interceptor catches
it. We can then go in and change the name of our file to remove the .jpg and then
continue the post request.

By doing so we receive the flag 46910d9ce35b385885a9f7e2b336249d622f29b267a1771fbacf52133beddba8


Prevention:

The best way of preventing this is making sure that the backend is checking what
is coming through from the post request and responding appropriately.
