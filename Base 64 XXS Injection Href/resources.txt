HTML Injection href data:
INFO:

Flag - 928d819fc19405ae09921a2b71227bd9aba106f9d2d37ac412e9e5a750f1506d

STEPS:
By inspecting the images on the home page you can find that the second nsa image is surrounded by <a href="?page=media&src=nsa"/></a>

Reading over html injections in the resource below showed that data uri handlers such as an a tags href can be used for html xss injections with base64 data.

The second resource explains that you can convert javascript injections into base64 and pass it as the data in the src part of the href.

Using a base64 encoder we convert <script>alert('suhhh dude')</script> into PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnc3VoaGggZHVkZScpPC9zY3JpcHQ+

Replacing the src=nsa with the example given in the first resource src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnc3VoaGggZHVkZScpPC9zY3JpcHQ+

And then clicking on the image takes us to a new page with the flag.


PREVENTION:

Avoid inserting the data of the URL directly on the page. Pass and ID instead that would be used to point to images from the DB.
