STEPS:
When clicking on the link at the bottom of the homepage we get redirected to a page
that is all about albatrosses. Because the page is so weird we decided to inspect
the markup.

There are comments left on in the html markup that mention things like

You must cumming from : "https://www.nsa.gov/" to go to the next step
Let's use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot.

This gives us a hint that we need to modify the header to say we are coming from
the nsa website and that we are using a browser of ft_bornToSec.

In order to see what headers are being sent through the page we used the HTTP Header
Live Firefox add-on. It shows every request going through the site and their details.
We then needed to be able to change the header that would be sent when arriving at
the albatross url.

To accomplish this we came across the Firefox Add-on Simple Modify Headers which
allows you to specify a url you would like to manipulate the header for. Every
time you visit the url it will change the header to what you have specified.
We set it up to use https://www.nsa.gov/ as the referer and ft_bornToSec as the
User-Agent. We then refresh the page and we are greeted with the flag.

PREVENTION:
The best way to prevent a more malicious attack which could allow someone to access
restricted pages is to use a system of token authentication such as Json Web Token.
This way you can be sure that the user is who they say they are and not show special
information based on data that could easily be changed.
