Survey HTML Data Injection
INFO:

Flag - 03a944b434d5baff05f46c4bede5792551a2595574bcafc9a6e25f67c382ccaa


STEPS:
If you inspect the page on the survey drop down where the values are selected you will see the option html tag with a set value

If we change the value to something like 100000 and select that option the site will run its submit code ad we are returned the flag.

AVOIDANCE:
Make sure that the function that is processing the change checks for values that are bigger than it expects
