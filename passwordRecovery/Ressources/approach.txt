$ curl -i http://10.11.200.225/?page=recover
Analyzed the output and spotted potential vulnerability:
<input type="hidden" name="mail" value="webmaster@borntosec.com" maxlength="15">
	<input type="submit" name="Submit" value= "Submit">
In Chrome, I inspected element of SUBMIT button, and changed nearby hidden code  to: <input type="hidden" name="admin" value="webmaster@borntosec.com" maxlength="15">
Any change of name and value params of this line of code results in obtaining the flag.

To avoid such a vulnerability an email address value should be handled by backend not the front.
